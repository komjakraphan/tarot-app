            <h2>What is tarot?</h2>
            <p>A divination tool that uses a deck of 78 cards, each with symbolic imagery and meanings, to provide
                insight, guidance, and reflection on various aspects of life. The first known believed origin was a 15th
                century European card game, but some believe it is much older. Now, it has become associated with
                mysticism and fortune-telling.</p>
            <h3>Note</h3>

            <h2>The tarot deck</h2>
            <p>78 cards divided into 2 types Major and Minor Arcana. The Major Arcana cards depict the fool’s journey of
                self discovery white the minor Arcana cards depict daily life. Below is a quick overview of the deck and
                their meanings. Each card can have 2 meanings, an upright or reversed meaning which means there are 156
                interpretations.</p>
            <h2>Major Arcana (22 Cards)</h2>
